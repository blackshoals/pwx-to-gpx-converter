pwx-to-gpx-converter
====================

A Python script to convert .PWX files from the Timex Global Trainer GPS watch to .GPX format for import to Garmin Connect, etc. The user enters the directory where the .PWX files reside and whether the .PWX files should be deleted after conversion ( modify the 'User Config' area at the top of the script). The script will loop through the chosen directory and convert all .PWX files.
